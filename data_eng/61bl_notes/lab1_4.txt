Lab 1 - 4

Lab2
1. Primitives
2. Class, constructors
3. Instance variables, instance methods
4. Getter and Setter methods

Lab3
1. If .. Else
2. While (condition) {}
3. For(initialization; condition/test; increment) {}
4. Break/Continue statement
5. Multidimensional Arrays
6. Do ... while statements (inverted while statement): `do {} while (_condition_);
7. switch Statements:
  switch (x) {
    case 0: amount = "zero";
      break;
    case 1: amount = "one";
      break;
    default: amount = "greater than 5";
      break;
  }
  one thing to watch out for switch statement is that it's a fall-through method until the `break` statement. If `break` exists only at the end, then all the conditions/functions will be evaluated + run.
8. Labeled continue/break Statement
outerloop:
for (init; condition) {
  innerloop:
  for (init; condition) {
    
  }
}
